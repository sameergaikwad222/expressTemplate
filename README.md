## Introduction

This is a basic Node.js Express project template designed to serve as a starting point for your web applications. It provides a simple and organized structure, allowing you to focus on building features rather than setting up the project from scratch.

## Features

List the key features of your project. This could include:

- Express Framework: Built on the widely used Express framework, making it easy to create robust and scalable web applications.
- MongoDB Integration: Seamlessly connect to MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database, for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Mongoose ODM: Utilizes Mongoose, an elegant MongoDB object modeling tool, to simplify interactions with the database.
- Project Structure: A well-defined project structure that encourages separation of concerns and maintainability.
- Routing: Basic routing setup with example routes to help you get started quickly.
- Configuration: Environment configuration setup for handling different development stages.
- Package Management: Utilizes npm for easy installation of project dependencies.
